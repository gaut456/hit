INTRODUCTION

Due to the fast growth of internet there has been big volume of information is 
produced and shared by various administrations in nearly every business, industry 
and other fields. Due to this high explosion itâ€™s really a big challenge to store, 
manage and access knowledge from this. According to the IDC (interactive data corporation)
estimation 90% of data is unstructured data which is a fastest growing data whereas the 
remaining is the structured data. IDC is also known as an American company that provides 
financial market data. According to these studies, 80% of all stored organizational data 
is unstructured .Unstructured data does not have any data structure (i.e. exists within 
a database). 
Examples of unstructured data may include
1. Textual: documents, presentations, spread sheets, scanned images, etc.
2. Imagery: multimedia files, streaming video, etc.
3. HUMINT: reports, audio files, and gestures
4. Sensors: seismic, acoustic, magnetic, sonar, etc. and
5. Environmental: weather 

This presents a critical challenge for large data technologies specifically in the area of 
data exchange because unstructured data must be structured before knowledge can be extracted .

Background Study on Unstructured Data

Today knowledge is the biggest asset of all companies so maximum of the knowledge is recorded 
in unstructured format. Unstructured data is a significant part of the Big Data explosion, and 
91% of the respondents in the survey say they are aware of unstructured data files within their 
enterprise systems . More than one-fourth of the survey respondents now say that the majority 
of their enterprise data is unstructured.

A. Structured data:

Structured data is a data included in relational database system. Examples are database tables,
objects, tags, reports, indexes etc. Being structured and highly organized it can be managed by 
SQL and its multiple variations developed by IBM, ADO.net, ODBC and many RDBMS support. Due to 
explicit semantics and structure efficient search is possible for focused content by simple and
straightforward search engines.

B. Semi structured data:

Semi structured data is one type of structured data but lacks the data model structure or do not 
conform a formal or rigid structure. This semi structured data do not require a schema definition 
it is rather optional and contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce 
hierarchies of records fields within the data. Semi structured data is increasingly occurring since 
full-text documents and databases are not the only forms of data on the Internet, and different applications
need a medium for exchanging information [4]. Language like XML or other mark-up language, Java script 
object notation (JSON) issued to manage semi structured data. To convert the semi structured data to 
structured data traditional data mining techniques or natural processing language is used.

C. Unstructured data:
Unstructured data is data comes from machines generated or human generated and it is broadly classifiedinto two types
1. Non-Textual unstructured data is a multimedia data like still images, videos, and MP3 audio files
2. Textual unstructured data examples are like email messages, collaborative software and instant messages memos, word processor documents, PowerPoint presentations etc.

And the different standards for unstructured data are open XML, SMTP, SMS, CSV and Information and content exchange .

Almost all applications use database and Information Retrieval system for storing and retrieving operational 
data i.e. query processing. But in current time most of the users on internet are not interested in huge amount 
of results. They look for specific type of information with in short time that can be retrieving after resolving
cardinality estimation. The new challenge requires several changes that vary from introducing new query language 
constructs to enhancing the query processing and optimization engines with new query operators. This paper 
presented a survey of query optimization on unstructured database.
