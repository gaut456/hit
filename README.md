INTRODUCTION

Due to the fast growth of internet there has been big volume of information is 
produced and shared by various administrations in nearly every business, industry 
and other fields. Due to this high explosion itâ€™s really a big challenge to store, 
manage and access knowledge from this. According to the IDC (interactive data corporation)
estimation 90% of data is unstructured data which is a fastest growing data whereas the 
remaining is the structured data. IDC is also known as an American company that provides 
financial market data. According to these studies, 80% of all stored organizational data 
is unstructured [1, 2].Unstructured data does not have any data structure (i.e. exists within 
a database). 
Examples of unstructured data may include
1. Textual: documents, presentations, spread sheets, scanned images, etc.
2. Imagery: multimedia files, streaming video, etc.
3. HUMINT: reports, audio files, and gestures
4. Sensors: seismic, acoustic, magnetic, sonar, etc. and
5. Environmental: weather 

This presents a critical challenge for large data technologies specifically in the area of 
data exchange because unstructured data must be structured before knowledge can be extracted [3].
